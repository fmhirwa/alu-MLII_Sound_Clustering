Sound CLustering

1. Use T4 GPU
2. Recommended loading to google drive since upload of 3000 files takes a long time.
3. The files need to be in the contents directory (same as sample_data)
4. The folder with the wav files should be named unlabelled_sounds --> The logic uses the wav count to identify and sample for the initial results.
5. Rest of instructions in colab notebook.
